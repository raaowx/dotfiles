# Dotfiles

This repository have been created for store and backup all configurations of my development tools. All files have been created thinking only in my workflows. I make it public because I want to share it, if you find something useful, feel free to copy it.  

## Bash

The folder contains all my configurations for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell. In those files you will find all my environment variables, aliases, functions, etc.  

## Nano

The folder contains my configuration for [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) editor.  

## VSCode

The folder contains my configuration for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor and the list of extensions I use. Yeah! I know VSCode can handle [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) for me, but I don't like the way it's done. I prefer to have all configurations in the same repository.  

## XCode

The folder contains my favourite themes for [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) editor.  

## Licensing

All configuration files are under the same [license](./LICENSE.txt).
